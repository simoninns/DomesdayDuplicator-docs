# The RM Series RMC12010 Remote

A service remote control is required for calibration. The RM Series RMC12010 remote is a 3rd party service remote clone available from sites such as Ebay. The RMC12010 remote required is shown in the following picture:

# RM Series RMC12010 Remote
Please note that the RMC12010 remote does not correctly map the MULTI-REV and MULTI-FWD buttons for the LD-V4300D (and these buttons are required for the calibration process). The correct codes for these buttons are given in the [Pioneer LD-V4300D Overview.md](https://www.domesday86.com/?page_id=1176) page. You can use either a combination of the RMC12010 and the Pioneer CU-V113A remote, or use a programmable remote and the key-codes provided on the linked page from this site.

Pioneer service remote controls produced after the GGF1067 do not seem to produce the correct key-codes for MULTI-REV or MULTI-FWD either.  Again, a combination of the CU-V113A and the service remote can be used.

The mapping of the RMC12010 service remote keys (to the original service remote keys) are shown in the following table (note: the most important one to know is ESS followed by TEST which switches the player into test mode (there is no need to power on holding DISPLAY or use any DIP switch settings on the LD-V4300D)):
