# The ld-decode Family

The Domesday Duplicator ecosystem includes a family of specialized decoders for various media formats. These tools process raw RF (radio frequency) data captured from analog media to produce usable video and audio.

## ls-decode - LaserDisc Decoding

LD-Decode is a software decoder for LaserDiscs that processes the raw RF data captured by the Domesday Duplicator.  This is the project for which the DdD was originally created.
