# Social Media 

You can follow the primary ld-decode developers on social media:

[Simon](https://mastodon.online/@simoni) - Member of the Domesday86 project and primary developer of the ld-decode post-processing tool-chain.

## Discord

There is a quite active Discord server of which most current development and usage of the project is discussed and home to other software decoding projects such as `vhs-decode`/`cvbs-decode`/`hifi-decode` & `FL2k TBC Player`

## Legacy IRC

We still have an IRC that is linked to the Discord for those interested but do not wish to join Discord.

However this is limited to only one channel of several inside the server and lacks access to the years of searchable messages.
